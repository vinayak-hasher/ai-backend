Here is the FastAPI-compatible Python service function that will pass all the tests:
```
from fastapi import Depends
from your_app.models import LeaveRequest, Manager, User

def approve_or_reject_leave_request(user: User, leave_request: LeaveRequest, action: str, comment: str):
    if not isinstance(user, Manager):
        raise PermissionError("Only managers can approve or reject leave requests")
    if not comment:
        raise ValueError("Comment is required")
    
    if action == 'approve':
        leave_request.status = 'approved'
    elif action == 'reject':
        leave_request.status = 'rejected'
    else:
        raise ValueError("Invalid action")
    
    leave_request.comments = comment
    leave_request.save()
```
Note that I've assumed the existence of a `User` model, which is not explicitly defined in the test file. I've also assumed that the `LeaveRequest` model has a `save` method to persist changes to the database.
