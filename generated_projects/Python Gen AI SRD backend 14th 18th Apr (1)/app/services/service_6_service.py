Here is the FastAPI-compatible Python service function that will pass all the tests:
```
from fastapi import FastAPI
from typing import Dict

app = FastAPI()

recommended_colleagues = {}

def recommend_colleague(employee: Dict, colleague: Dict, pod: Dict) -> Dict:
    if employee["id"] == colleague["id"]:
        raise ValueError("Cannot recommend the same employee as a colleague")
    
    if (employee["id"], colleague["id"], pod["id"]) in recommended_colleagues:
        raise ValueError("Colleague has already been recommended")
    
    recommended_colleagues[(employee["id"], colleague["id"], pod["id"])] = True
    
    return {"message": "Colleague recommended successfully"}
```
Note that I've used a simple in-memory dictionary `recommended_colleagues` to keep track of recommended colleagues. In a real-world scenario, you would likely want to use a database to store this information.
